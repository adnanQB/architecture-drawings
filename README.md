Architecture Drawings Repository
Welcome to the Architecture Drawings repository! This repository is dedicated to storing and managing architectural diagrams for our systems, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Kubernetes environments, and Essentials developed solutions.

This repository aims to:
Centralize Documentation: Serve as the single source of truth for all architectural diagrams and related documentation.
Facilitate Collaboration: Provide a shared space for team members to review, update, and discuss architectural designs and changes.
Enhance Understanding: Help stakeholders understand the architecture of our systems for better decision-making and planning.

Recommended Usage
For the best experience, we recommend using the draw.io VS Code plugin to view and edit the diagrams..
